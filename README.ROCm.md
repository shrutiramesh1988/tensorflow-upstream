# Tensorflow ROCm port #

## Introduction ##

This repository hosts the port of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) on ROCm platform. It uses various technologies on ROCm platform such as HIP and MIOpen. For details on HIP, please refer [here](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Tools/HIP). Optimized DNN library calls (via [MIOpen](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen)) are also supported within this codebase.
